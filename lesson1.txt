How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

   I could easily navigate to spots on the code where changes were introduced instead of searching through the whole code.
   
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

 
   It allows to remove bugs if introduced without loosing previous work.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?


    Pro-educes unnecessary versions
    Con-Forgetting to save manually may lead to changes not being saved

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

   
  If changes to be made on both the files are same then we can include it in a single commit and reduces versions

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

   
 Git log allows to see version history while diff shows differences bw versions


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

   
It erases the risk of breakdown and loss of code since it stores different versions
